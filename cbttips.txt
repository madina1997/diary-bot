•    Lower your standards. Pay attention to all facts and events, even the smallest ones. Appreciate yourself for the effort you put in instead of just looking at the results._
•    Dissect something big into several smaller facts. Often you can dissect positive data log events into smaller facts. Reflect on all the things you had to do to accomplish something important. Run through it again and write down each component. _
•    Take the circumstances into account. Your mood and condition will change from day to day, so it is wise to adapt your demands to the fact. Formulate it as follows: ‘Despite being somber, I still managed to …’. That makes it easier to discover something positive._
•    Repetition is important. Remember, you are allowed to record an event that you have written about before. Try not to see things you used to find hard or things you did not dare to do as matters of course. They are still special and the trick is to keep noticing them. _
•    Make it personal. Many people with low self-esteem find it hard to detect their condition to any pleasant event. Ask yourself what your contribution was. Surely you had something to do with the fact that it was a great atmosphere or that others were kind to you._
•    Block out negative mind talk. You have probably noticed that when you have written down something positive, you feel a strong tendency to add something negative. You are very good at trivializing or giving little value to positive events. This counteracts the positive, so you should aim not to do so._
•    Look at it another way for once. You should realize that there is more to life than achievements and dedication to others. Pay attention to other areas of life, such as enjoyment, assertiveness, hobbies, your relationship with your partner, sports you enjoy, your appearance, laughter, relaxation, and so on._
•    Pay attention to what you find had to do. Pay special attention to daily inhibitions in your positive data log. If you find it hard to relax, for instance, you can focus on times when you did manage to relax, even if it was a short time.
